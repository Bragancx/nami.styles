<!-- RULES -->

Just use the prefix 'is' when is not a main class, example:
if is a class to define display, it's a main class because it's defining some main attribute.
if it's a class that defines the color of text or size of something, then, can use the prefix.

why not in everything:
- bad reading.
- not intuitive.
- do things confuse.
